## Summary (blameless)

<2–3 lines: what happened, who/what was affected, business impact. Full write-up → `postmortem-writing` skill.>

## Traceability ↑ (which requirement failed in production)

| Failed | ID | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dependability `RNF` (avail/reliability/resilience) | `RNF-NN` | [RNF](../requirements/RNF/RNF-....md) — e.g. `AVAIL`/`RTO`/`RPO` breached |
| Acceptance Criterion (if a `CA` was violated) | `CANN` | [F-NN](../backlog/features/F-NN-....md) |

## Origin ← (how it surfaced)

- Triaged from: [`ISS-NN`](../backlog/support-quality-investigation/issues/ISS-NN-....md) *(an incident is a triage outcome of the issues inbox)* — or a monitoring alert (state which).

## Corrective actions ↓ (the loop back to the backlog)

| Action | Becomes | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Fix the defect | `BUG-NN` | [bugs/](../backlog/bugs/) |
| Technical / infra hardening | `TX-NN` | [support/](../backlog/support-quality-investigation/support/) |
| Capture the recovery procedure | `RB-NN` | [runbooks/](../runbooks/) |
| Tighten the requirement | RNF revision | the **requirements document first** (`SKILL.md §2.1`), then the backlog |

> **The loop**: an incident that changes a requirement flows through the requirements document **first** (rule zero) — never straight into the backlog. Each action item has a `BUG/TX/RB` id so it is tracked to closure.
